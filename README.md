**1-Better Word**: This function code compares 2 input strings and returns which one is better based on their length. /n
               I used BiPredicate as it returns a boolean value and based on this value it will return the better string of the 2 input strings.
**2-CheckAlpha**: This function code checks if all the characters of the string input is a letter or not.
